    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</h3></li>
      <li>
        <h3>Boil the pasta</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Put a large pot of salted wateron to boil (1 tablespoon salt for
            every 2quarts of water).
          </li>
          <li>
            the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook,
            uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 9 to 11 minutes, until
            mostly cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite.
          </li>
          <li>Using a colander, drain and set to the side.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><h3>Cook the ground beef:</h3></li>
      As the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the
      ground beef,
      <ul>
        <li>
          Season with oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground
          cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beefis browned and no
          longer pink, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Add the butter and aromatics:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add the butter, onions, garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with
            the ground beef. Stir until all ingredients are combined.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Combine the pasta and ground beef:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine. Add
            the heavy whipping cream, chicken stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2cups
            of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of the shredded
            cheddarcheese. Stir until combined.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Add to a casserole dish:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top
            with the remaining cheese.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bake:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is browned
            and bubbly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Serve and store:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For a looser casserole, serve right away. For a casserole that holds
            its shape a bit, let sit 10 minutes before serving. The casserole
            will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days. You
            can also freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to
            3 months. To reheat, microwave or place in the oven at 350°F oven
            until it is heated through (this will depend on the portion size you
            are reheating).
