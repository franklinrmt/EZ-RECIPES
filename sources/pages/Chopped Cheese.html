        <h3>Cook the ground beef</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add your ground beef to a large, dry pot or skillet over medium-low
            heat. Slowly cook so the fat renders out. Stir regularly, breaking
            up the beef as it cooks, until it is in crumbles but not fully
            cooked (some of the meat will still be pink)
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning: Once the beef is browned and
            most of the fat has rendered out (about 7-8 minutes of cooking)
          </li>
          <li>turn the heat up to medium and add onions and garlic.</li>
          <li>Cook for another 4-5 minutes until vegetables soften.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Season the filling with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>Remove from heat</li>

        <h3>Toast the buns:</h3>
        Slice your rolls in half and toast them in batches over a griddle or in
        a large skillet over medium heat until browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Combine the cheese and ground beef:</h3>
        For each sandwich, portion out about 1/6 of the beef filling at a time
        and add to the griddle or skillet over medium-low heat. Let the filling
        get hot and then cover it with two slices of American cheese. Let it sit
        long enough got the cheese to melt. If you like, roughly “chop” the
        cheese into the beef mixture with the side of a metal spatula.

        After 30 seconds, use a spatula to flip the roll, keeping the filling
        inside. If any filling falls out, use the spatula to add it back to the
        roll. Repeat as needed to make other sandwiches. Add shredded lettuce
        and sliced tomato to the sandwich. Cut in half and serve immediately.

        Leftover chopped cheese filling can be stored in the fridge in an
        airtight container for 3-4 days. You can add the filling straight from
        the fridge to a griddle to make a sandwich. Only make as many sandwiches
        as you need to, but if you have leftover filling, that’s great!
